              The Token Deploy Proposal is a critical part of the CoinGenesis Launchpad. It ensures that all tokens listed on our platform meet high standards of quality and compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TDP process involves submitting detailed information about the token, including its name, symbol, description, social media links, website, and contact details.

              For individual deployers, an essential requirement is either KYC or a Gitcoin Passport Score of at least 40. For corporate deployers, KYC is mandatory. Optional information such as a whitepaper for individuals and a roadmap for corporates can also be submitted to provide a comprehensive overview of the project.
