## CoinGenesis Launchpad

**Introduction to CoinGenesis**

CoinGenesis is a Web3 Launchpad Platform specifically designed for memecoins, built on the Scroll Layer-2 Blockchain.
CoinGenesis stands out by offering unique features and a robust verification process for token deployment, ensuring a secure and efficient launch experience for developers and users alike.
CoinGenesis combines several key components to create an all-in-one solution for launching and trading tokens.

## Key Features

**Token Deploy Proposal**

The Token Deploy Proposal is a critical part of the CoinGenesis Launchpad. It ensures that all tokens listed on our platform meet high standards of quality and compliance.
The TDP process involves submitting detailed information about the token, including its name, symbol, description, social media links, website, and contact details.
For individual deployers, an essential requirement is either KYC or a Gitcoin Passport Score >40. For corporate deployers, KYC is mandatory. Optional information such as a whitepaper for individuals and a roadmap for corporates can also be submitted to provide a comprehensive overview of the project.

**Certified Deployer Attestation**

The Certified Deployer Attestation is an exclusive recognition given to developers who have demonstrated consistent success in launching tokens on the CoinGenesis platform. To qualify, a deployer must have launched at least three tokens, all of which must comply with CoinGenesisâ€™s guidelines and regulatory requirements.
Certified deployers benefit from increased visibility, priority support from the CoinGenesis Team, and access to exclusive networking events. This badge of distinction not only highlights their reliability and experience but also enhances their attractiveness to potential investors and partners.

**Pre-Market Trading**

Pre-Market Trading feature allows tokens to be traded before their official market release. This unique offering provides early liquidity and access for investors, setting CoinGenesis apart from other launchpad platforms. It allows token deployers to gauge market interest and secure early investments, contributing to a more successful token launch.
